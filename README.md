# Arduino-Pan-and-Tilt-Servo-System-with-Manual-and-Automatic-Control
This repository contains the Arduino code and documentation for a pan and tilt servo system with manual and automatic control. The system consists of two servos, where the lower servo is controlled using a potentiometer. The project includes functionality for manual control using the potentiometer and automatic control with predefined angles.

### Features:
- Manual Control: Use the potentiometer to manually control the position of the servo.
- Automatic Control: Define and save specific angles by turning the servo with the potentiometer and pressing buttons.
- Button Functions: Button 1 for manual control, Button 2 for automatic control, Button 3 for saving the first angle, and Button 4 for saving the second angle.

### Instructions:
1. Press Button 1 for manual control using the potentiometer.
2. Press Button 2 for automatic control with predefined angles.
3. Save the first angle: Turn the servo with the potentiometer to the desired position and press Button 3.
4. Save the second angle: Turn the servo again and press Button 4.
5. Press Button 2 again for automatic control, and the servo will move between the saved angles.
